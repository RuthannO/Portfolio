    <h2>About</h2>
    <img class="thumbnail"  src="png/img.png" alt="Jamaican girl with an afro(chibi)">
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! <p>I’m genuinely excited to share my journey and projects with you.</p>

        <p>I’m an aspiring developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Python, and Java. My passion lies in web and software development, fields</p><p> where I continually seek to grow and innovate. What drives me is a blend of self-motivation and formal education; I'm largely self-taught but currently enhancing my skills through a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).</p>
        
        <p>With over four years of experience as an IT Support Technician, I’ve developed a deep understanding of technology's practical and user-centric side. <p>This experience has been invaluable, guiding my recent shift towards programming—a realm where I can blend creativity with technical prowess.
        
        My fascination with AI and its potential to positively impact the world is a significant part of my career focus.</p> <p> I believe in using technology not just as a tool, but as a means to make meaningful contributions to society.
      I hope you find my work both informative and inspiring. Let’s connect and explore how we can make a positive difference in the world through technology!</p>
